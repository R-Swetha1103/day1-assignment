1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

=> HTTP:
    .  HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol
    .  It is the basis for almost all web applications.     .  HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.
    .  The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997 this first version of HTTP was called HTTP1.1. This version is still in use on the web. 
    .  In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP2 was created.
       
=> HTTP1.1:
    .  Sequential Request Processing: 
           Each request is handled one at a time, often leading to head of line blocking, where one slow request delays others.

    . 	Multiple Connections:
           To load a webpage with multiple resources, browsers often open several TCP connections simultaneously, increasing overhead and resource consumption.
    
     .   Text-Based Protocol:
            HTTP1.1 uses plain text for communication, which, while easy to debug, is not the most efficient.

=> HTTP2: 
      To address the limitations of HTTP1.1 and improve performance, HTTP2 was developed and standardized in 2015.
   
      .  Binary Protocol: 
            HTTP2 switches from a text-based to a binary format, which is more efficient and less to errors. 

      .  Multiplexing:
            Multiple requests and responses can be handled simultaneously over a single connection, preventing head of line blocking.

      .  Header Compression:
            HTTP2 uses HPACK compression to reduce the size of headers, decreasing latency and improving load times. 

      .  Stream Prioritization:
            Allows clients to prioritize streams, ensuring critical resources load first.

      .  Server Push:
            Servers can proactively send resources to clients, reducing the need for additional requests and lowering latency.


HTTP2 is not just an upgrade it's a transformation of web communication. By addressing the inefficiencies of HTTP1.1, HTTP2 offers a faster, more secure, and more reliable web experience. For developers, adopting HTTP2 is resolvable for delivering better user experiences and staying competitive in an increasingly digital world.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

=> Objects :
      Objects are complex data types that allow us to store collections of data and more complex entities.

=> Internal representation in javascript:
      JavaScript represents objects as collections of properties. 

      .  Properties and Methods: 
            Properties are variables attached to objects, while methods are functions attached to objects. Both are represented similarly as key value pairs.

      .  Prototypes:
            JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance. Each object has an inter link to another object called its prototype.

      .  Property Attributes:
            Each property in JavaScript objects has attributes that define its behavior, such as whether it's writable, enumerable, or configurable.
